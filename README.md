# Dog Breed Identification
This notebook presents a solution for Kaggle's dog breed identification challenge (https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification). 
In this playground competition, a strictly canine subset of ImageNet dataset was provided. With 120 breeds of dogs and only a limited number training images per class made this classification problem a little challenging. Since there are only around 100 training images on average per class, training a convolution network from scratch would result in overfitting the model to the training data. Hence, a better approach would be to use a model pretrained on Imagenet dataset. We can this model as a feature extracter and then using these extracted features we can train a simple model like logistic regression or a shallow fully connected Neural network. This approach is called transfer learning.(More on transfer learning here - http://cs231n.github.io/transfer-learning) As base model, I tried a few different models like ResNet50, InceptionV3, Xception but found that Inception-ResNet-v2 (https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07261) gave higher accuracy compared to other models. I have used Keras deep learning library on top of tensorflow. Keras makes life easy while prototyping and experimenting with different ideas.
